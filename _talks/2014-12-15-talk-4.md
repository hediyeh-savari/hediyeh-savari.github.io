This project aimed to introduce students across electrical engineering majors to diverse career opportunities within the field. Following a rigorous application and voting process, I was honored to be one of the seven elected members of the Board of Directors. Throughout this experience, I actively participated in weekly meetings under the guidance of Dr. Ali Akbar Jalali, a distinguished professor in the control group. These sessions provided a platform for reviewing and refining the project's objectives, as well as assigning new responsibilities to board members.

This invaluable experience significantly broadened my horizons, offering a profound insight into the intricate relationship between my field of study and the industry, thus enhancing my understanding of electrical engineering from an industry perspective.
