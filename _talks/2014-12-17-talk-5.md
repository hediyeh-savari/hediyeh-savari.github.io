In 2014, Dr. Ali Akbar Jalali, a distinguished member of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, led the 'Project for the Introduction of Electrical Engineering Careers' at Iran University of Science and Technology. This year-long project offered electrical engineering students a unique opportunity to delve into their field, select a career of personal interest, and systematically publish their research findings.

  <br>
Throughout the project's duration, Dr. Jalali's team provided continuous evaluation and guidance. At the culmination of the program, I was honored to achieve first place among the 130 participating students, earning a Certificate of Appreciation in recognition of my accomplishments.
