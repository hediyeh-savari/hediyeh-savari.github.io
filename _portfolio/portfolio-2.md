<h1>1. Employing Shadow Mask and DC Sputtering Techniques in Electrode Design</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    The selection of silver as the electrode material for the sensor was based on its superior conductivity attributed to its single valence electron. To achieve high precision in electrode fabrication, the DC-Sputtering method was chosen.
</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    In this research, two types of masks were designed for electrode fabrication using CorelDRAW, as illustrated in Figure 3. The electrode displayed in Figure 3-(a) was found to be appropriate for the sensor array. In fact, by employing these electrodes, it is possible to fabricate four different types of sensors on a common substrate based on the number of fingers. However, if the electrode (b) type is utilized, only one type of sensor can be produced on the substrate. The measurement accuracy of the electrode (b) type is higher than that of the other type. Therefore, for this study, the electrode (b) type was chosen.

<h1>7. DC-Sputtering of Silver</h1>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The DC-sputtering instrument was utilized to deposit silver on the surface of TPU. The samples were placed in the instrument, and the setup was adjusted to 20% power for a duration of 300 seconds. During the process, a purple-colored Argon plasma was created within the chamber and physical sputtering was conducted. The operation was performed four times to ensure a thin layer of silver with high conductivity was deposited onto the TPU surface.
<br>
Through this novel method, electrodes were patterned with an exceptional level of uniformity and accuracy of 100 microns on a highly flexible TPU surface. The method was characterized by its remarkable precision and cleanliness, ensuring that no contaminants entered the sensor substrate and the intended design was successfully achieved. The technique offers versatility, as it enables the deposition of a variety of materials with desired patterns onto a range of substrates.

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In the simulation conducted for this thesis, the effect of various laser parameters on its output spectrum is examined. Through these investigations, it was determined that the laser bandwidth is directly influenced by three parameters: t (the width of the active area), d (the total width of the active area and waveguide layers), and Jth (the threshold current density). However, no effect on the laser output spectrum was observed from other parameters, such as γ (cavity loss), L (cavity length), A (cavity cross-sectional area), etc.
 <br>
To assess the impact of these three mentioned parameters, two of them are designated as variables in each trial, while the remaining parameter is maintained as a constant. Subsequently, utilizing Wolfram Mathematica software, the bandwidth diagram will be generated with respect to the two variable parameters. The effect of these parameters on the laser bandwidth will be observed and assessed. The range of variable values is selected to ensure that the laser's output bandwidth remains below 5 nm, aligning with the project's objectives.

<h1>1. The First Laser Structure</h1>
 <div style='text-align: justify;'>
 The laser structure proposed here comprises three GaAs quantum wells that are separated by Al<sub>0.35</sub>Ga<sub>0.65</sub>As barriers. The presence of more than one quantum well in the structure leads to an elevation in the probability of radiative recombination, driven by the heightened quantum confinement of electrons and holes and the augmented density of states. Furthermore, increased radiative recombination guarantees an enhancement in output efficiency.

<h1>2. The Second Laser Structure</h1>
  <div style='text-align: justify;'>
According to band edge calculations, the band gap energy corresponding to the In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1-x-y</sub>As structure with In and Al contents of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively, is found to be 1.48 eV at room temperature. Since the limitation of the quantum well is causing the energy levels of the ground state to be shifted towards higher energies, the radiant energy of the structure is determined by the length of the quantum well. According to the laboratory results reported for this structure, light is emitted at 792 nm at zero Kelvin temperature and at 808±1 nm at room temperature when a quantum well with a thickness of 8 nm is employed.

<h1>3. The Third Laser Structure</h1>
   <div style='text-align: justify;'>
   It was observed that light is emitted at a wavelength of 805 nm at room temperature by the two structures that were previously investigated for this system. Due to the considerably larger active layer thickness of 40 nm in the previous structures compared to the typical thickness (t < 15 nm) used for quantum wells, it was found that the impact of thickness on the wavelength of the output light in this system is not substantial, and the edge of the conduction band and the capacitance are regarded as the ground state energy of the electron and the hole, respectively.
<br>
In this manner, achieving an output wavelength of 808 nm at room temperature can only be accomplished by altering the content of participating elements in the active region. The calculations conducted on the band structure reveal that the structure in which the active region In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As<sub>y</sub>P<sub>1-y</sub> has an In content equal to 0.16 (with Ga content of 0.84) and an As content equal to 0.71 (with P content of 0.29) emits light at a wavelength of approximately 808 nm at room temperature. In such a case, the inconsistency of the In<sub>0.16</sub>Ga<sub>0.84</sub>As<sub>0.71</sub>P<sub>0.29</sub> network with the GaAs network is only 0.09%. This slight inconsistency ensures the possibility of two-dimensional growth with significant thicknesses of In<sub>0.16</sub>Ga<sub>0.84</sub>As<sub>0.71</sub>P<sub>0.29</sub>. Additionally, In<sub>0.16</sub>Ga<sub>0.84</sub>As<sub>0.71</sub>P<sub>0.29</sub> possesses a direct energy gap, indicating a high probability of electron-hole recombination within this system.
