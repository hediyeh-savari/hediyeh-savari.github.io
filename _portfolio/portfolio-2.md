<h1>1. Fabrication of Flexible Electrode Using the Photolithography Method</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
  In this research, two types of masks were designed for electrode fabrication using CorelDRAW, as illustrated in Fig.1. The electrode displayed in Fig.1-(a) was found to be appropriate for the sensor array. In fact, by employing these electrodes, it is possible to fabricate four different types of sensors on a common substrate based on the number of fingers. However, if the electrode (b) type is utilized, only one type of sensor can be produced on the substrate. The measurement accuracy of the electrode (b) type is higher than that of the other type. Therefore, for this study, the electrode (b) type was chosen.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
After the silver nanowires were synthesized and centrifuged, photolithography was performed on them using the lift-off method to obtain the mask pattern. To carry out photolithography on the TPU electrodes, the designed mask was inserted onto the TPU. However, due to the high flexibility of the TPU sheet, a lam was employed as a support to facilitate the fitting of the mask, as demonstrated in the figure below. The settings of the photolithography device were configured as follows: Time was set to 10 seconds, intensity was set at 100%, and the LED was turned on. The result of the photolithography of silver nanowires was not favorable, and the mask pattern did not appear on the TPU.

<h1>2. Fabrication of Flexible Electrode via 3D Printing</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
 In another attempt, a 3D printer was employed to design the silver nanowires. The setup of a 3D printer was established for coating silver nanowires on three different substrates: polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, and thermoplastic polyurethane. The final result was deemed inappropriate. The reason for this was attributed to the low viscosity of the silver nanowire solution.

<h1>3. Fabrication of Flexible Electrodes through Silver Nanowire Deposition Using a Spray Gun</h1>
Another method that was explored involved the deposition of silver nanowires using a spray gun. In this method, the nanowires were subjected to significant pressure, resulting in their crushing and breakage, which led to the manifestation of very high resistance. With high applied pressure, a relatively uniform layer was formed on the surface, but it resulted in the deformation of the nanowires. Conversely, when the pressure was reduced, the coating became non-uniform. This method also yielded unsatisfactory results, leading to its rejection.




<h1>4. Fabrication of Flexible Electrode via Silver Nanowire Patterning Using the Drop-Casting Method with a Shadow Mask</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The solution of silver nanowires dissolved in water was combined with HEC and rendered uniform through esterification. Additionally, the shadow mask was affixed to the TPU sheet. Subsequently, this solution was poured onto the mask using the drop-casting method to fill the empty areas of the TPU. The sample was then positioned on a hot plate for 30 minutes, heated to 80°C, and dried. Finally, the mask was gently removed from the TPU surface, yielding the following result.

(c) The solution was dried by heating it on a hot plate. (d) The shadow mask was removed from the TPU sheet. (e) The electrical resistance of the electrodes formed on the TPU was measured.</figcaption>
 <br> 
</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The resistance of each electrode was found to be 2.2 kΩ, which was deemed high for silver nanowires with a conductivity of 3 Ω. Conversely, when the mask was removed from the TPU surface, some of the silver nanowires that had adhered to the mask were lifted along with it. Furthermore, the layer on the TPU surface was found to be non-uniform. Consequently, this method was also rejected.

<h1>1. Employing Shadow Mask and DC Sputtering Techniques in Electrode Design</h1>
 <div style='text-align: justify;'>
The selection of silver as the electrode material for the sensor was based on its superior conductivity attributed to its single valence electron. To achieve high precision in electrode fabrication, the DC-Sputtering method was chosen.

In this research, two types of masks were designed for electrode fabrication using CorelDRAW, as illustrated in Figure 3.

<h1>7. DC-Sputtering of Silver</h1>
 <div style='text-align: justify;'>
The DC-sputtering instrument was utilized to deposit silver on the surface of TPU. The samples were placed in the instrument, and the setup was adjusted to 20% power for a duration of 300 seconds. During the process, a purple-colored Argon plasma was created within the chamber and physical sputtering was conducted. The operation was performed four times to ensure a thin layer of silver with high conductivity was deposited onto the TPU surface.
 <br>
Through this novel method, electrodes were patterned with an exceptional level of uniformity and accuracy of 100 microns on a highly flexible TPU surface. The method was characterized by its remarkable precision and cleanliness, ensuring that no contaminants entered the sensor substrate and the intended design was successfully achieved. The technique offers versatility, as it enables the deposition of a variety of materials with desired patterns onto a range of substrates.
