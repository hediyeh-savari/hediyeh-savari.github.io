<h1>1. Employing Shadow Mask and DC Sputtering Techniques in Electrode Design</h1>
 <div style='text-align: justify;'>
The selection of silver as the electrode material for the sensor was based on its superior conductivity attributed to its single valence electron. To achieve high precision in electrode fabrication, the DC-Sputtering method was chosen.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In this research, two types of masks were designed for electrode fabrication using CorelDRAW, as illustrated in Figure 3. The electrode displayed in Figure 3-(a) was found to be appropriate for the sensor array. In fact, by employing these electrodes, it is possible to fabricate four different types of sensors on a common substrate based on the number of fingers. However, if the electrode (b) type is utilized, only one type of sensor can be produced on the substrate. The measurement accuracy of the electrode (b) type is higher than that of the other type. Therefore, for this study, the electrode (b) type was chosen.

<h1>7. DC-Sputtering of Silver</h1>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The DC-sputtering instrument was utilized to deposit silver on the surface of TPU. The samples were placed in the instrument, and the setup was adjusted to 20% power for a duration of 300 seconds. During the process, a purple-colored Argon plasma was created within the chamber and physical sputtering was conducted. The operation was performed four times to ensure a thin layer of silver with high conductivity was deposited onto the TPU surface.
 <br>
Through this novel method, electrodes were patterned with an exceptional level of uniformity and accuracy of 100 microns on a highly flexible TPU surface. The method was characterized by its remarkable precision and cleanliness, ensuring that no contaminants entered the sensor substrate and the intended design was successfully achieved. The technique offers versatility, as it enables the deposition of a variety of materials with desired patterns onto a range of substrates.
