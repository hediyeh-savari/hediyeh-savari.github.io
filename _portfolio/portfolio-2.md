* May. 2021 - Sep. 2021: Research Assistant
  * [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en)
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Nikfarjam](https://fnst.ut.ac.ir/en/~a.nikfarjam)
  * Title: Design and Fabrication of Superconducting, Stable, and Low-Cost Electrodes on Flexible Substrates
  * Duties included: Examining various materials to select the **most suitable** one for use as the **electrode**; Investigating different materials for potential use as a **flexible, transparent, and stretchable substrate**; Exploring various coating methods to **create precise electrode patterns**; Assessing the **durability**, **stability**, and **conductivity** of fabricated flexible electrodes and **optimizing** their **characteristics**.

Here is a visual showcase depicting various steps of the project through the following images.
