<h1>Summary</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In the simulation conducted for this thesis, the effect of various laser parameters on its output spectrum is examined. Through these investigations, it was determined that the laser bandwidth is directly influenced by three parameters: t (the width of the active area), d (the total width of the active area and waveguide layers), and Jth (the threshold current density). However, no effect on the laser output spectrum was observed from other parameters, such as γ (cavity loss), L (cavity length), A (cavity cross-sectional area), etc.
 <br>
To assess the impact of these three mentioned parameters, two of them are designated as variables in each trial, while the remaining parameter is maintained as a constant. Subsequently, utilizing Wolfram Mathematica software, the bandwidth diagram will be generated with respect to the two variable parameters. The effect of these parameters on the laser bandwidth will be observed and assessed. The range of variable values is selected to ensure that the laser's output bandwidth remains below 5 nm, aligning with the project's objectives.

<h1>1. The First Structure</h1>
 The laser structure proposed here comprises three GaAs quantum wells that are separated by Al0.35Ga0.65As barriers. The presence of more than one quantum well in the structure leads to an elevation in the probability of radiative recombination, driven by the heightened quantum confinement of electrons and holes and the augmented density of states. Furthermore, increased radiative recombination guarantees an enhancement in output efficiency.

    <td><strong>Fig.1_1</strong>: In this case, it is assumed that the parameters 'd' and 't' are variable, while the 'J<sub>th</sub>' parameter is held constant. The bandwidth diagram is created using the Plot-3D command in Wolfram Mathematica. As indicated by the plot, Δλ is found to be independent of 't,' but it is influenced by changes in 'd'. It is noteworthy that the slope of Δλ experiences an increasing shift for 'd' values smaller than 60 nm.</td>

As illustrated in the plot, Δλ is observed to be responsive to variations in both 'd' and 'J<sub>th</sub>' in this particular scenario. These changes peak when 'J<sub>th</sub>' values exceed 1x10<sup>6</sup> amperes per square and 'd' values are below 40 nm.</td>

As portrayed in the plot, in this scenario, Δλ is found to be unaffected by 't' but exhibits a linear response to alterations in 'J<sub>th</sub>'.</td>
