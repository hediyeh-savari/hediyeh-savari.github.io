<h1>Abstract</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In recent years, transparent and flexible materials such as conductive polymers, nanotube networks, graphene electrodes, and metal nanowires have been employed for the fabrication of electrodes, instead of ITO. Among the mentioned items, metal nanowires, especially silver nanowires, are considered the best options for the fabrication of conductive, transparent, and flexible electrodes (FTCEs).
   <br>
 The reasons for this preference are as follows:
  <br>
• Compatibility with the environment is ensured.
  <br>
• The manufacturing process is based on solutions.
  <br>
• High conductivity is exhibited.
  <br>
• Synthesis on a large scale can be carried out.

<h1>Synthesis of Silver Nanowires Using the Polyol Method</h1>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In this research, the synthesis of silver nanowires was carried out using the polyol method in accordance with the reference recipe [1].
  <br>
The required materials for this synthesis include the following:
   <br>
• Ethylene glycol
  <br>
• Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (Mw=360000)
  <br>
• Silver nitrate
  <br>
• Iron (III) chloride
  <br>
To achieve the synthesis of long nanowires, high molecular weight PVP should be employed. This is because the high molecular weight of PVP results in the generation of longer PVP molecular chains, consequently leading to the production of longer nanowires.

At room temperature, 100 ml of ethylene glycol was poured into a beaker, and 0.32 grams of PVP was added to it. The beaker was then placed on a hot plate to have PVP dissolved in ethylene glycol using a magnet (Fig.1). Subsequently, 0.72 grams of silver nitrate was added to the solution, and it was dissolved in ethylene glycol with a magnet. On the other hand, a 10 mL solution of 600 µM FeCl3 in ethylene glycol (i.e., 0.0009 g FeCl3 in 10 mL ethylene glycol) was added to the previous solution, and it was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for one minute. The solution was then placed on a hot plate at 130 (°C) and dissolved for 10 minutes with a magnetic stirrer. Next, the beaker was transferred to the oven, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 3 and a half hours without stirring. After this period, the beaker was removed from the oven and placed under the hood until the next day to cool (Fig.3).

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The next day, when the synthesized solution had cooled to room temperature, it was centrifuged to obtain pure silver nanowires. The contents of the beaker were divided into four falcon tubes. Falcons placed opposite each other in the centrifuge had to be of equal weight. Subsequently, all the falcon tubes were weighed and placed in the centrifuge. The solution was centrifuged at a temperature of 11°C for 10 minutes at a speed of 4500 rpm. The separated liquid, which was actually ethylene glycol, was discarded, and DI water was poured into the falcon tubes to separate the excess material from the nanowires after centrifugation. The solution was centrifuged again at a temperature of 11 (°C) at a speed of 4500 (rpm) for 10 minutes, and the separated liquid was discarded. Then, ethanol was poured into the falcon tubes to dissolve the PVP attached to the nanowires, which was subsequently discarded. Finally, the resulting silver nanowires were dispersed in water or ethanol and stored in the refrigerator.

A drop of the final solution is poured onto a microscope slide, and it is observed and examined under an optical microscope. According to the picture below, the synthesized silver nanowires are found to be of very high quality. However, due to its high concentration, it needs to be diluted for further investigation.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In the next step, a drop of the silver nanowire solution was diluted in a large amount of ethanol, and subsequently, it was placed on the microscope slide with the assistance of a syringe. It was then observed via the optical microscope that a long length and a small diameter (high aspect ratio) were achieved.

When these nanowires were coated onto various surfaces, it was observed that they did not adhere to the surface adequately and could be detached from the surface with minimal contact. To address this issue, different methods of enhancing adhesion were explored. Ultimately, Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) material was employed for this purpose, representing a cost-effective, straightforward, and efficient method.
