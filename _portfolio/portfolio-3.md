<h1>Abstract</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
This project focuses on the synthesis of silver nanowires using the Polyol method, with a specific emphasis on enhancing their properties and adhesion to substrates. The synthesis involves the use of high molecular weight PVP to produce long nanowires, and subsequent steps include centrifugation, examination of properties and structure, junction welding to reduce resistance, and addressing the issue of poor adhesion to substrates. The resulting silver nanowires exhibit high transparency, flexibility, and electrical conductivity, and their adhesion to surfaces is significantly improved through the incorporation of Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). The project offers a comprehensive approach to the fabrication of high-quality silver nanowires with improved performance characteristics and substrate adhesion.

<h1>Synthesis of Silver Nanowires Using the Polyol Method</h1>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In this research, the synthesis of silver nanowires was carried out using the polyol method in accordance with the reference recipe [1].
  <br>
The required materials for this synthesis include the following:
   <br>
• Ethylene glycol
  <br>
• Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (Mw=360000)
  <br>
• Silver nitrate
  <br>
• Iron (III) chloride
  <br>
To achieve the synthesis of long nanowires, high molecular weight PVP should be employed. This is because the high molecular weight of PVP results in the generation of longer PVP molecular chains, consequently leading to the production of longer nanowires.

At room temperature, 100 ml of ethylene glycol was poured into a beaker, and 0.32 grams of PVP was added to it. The beaker was then placed on a hot plate to have PVP dissolved in ethylene glycol using a magnet (Fig.1_1). Subsequently, 0.72 grams of silver nitrate was added to the solution, and it was dissolved in ethylene glycol with a magnet. On the other hand, a 10 mL solution of 600 µM FeCl3 in ethylene glycol (i.e., 0.0009 g FeCl3 in 10 mL ethylene glycol) was added to the previous solution, and it was stirred on a magnetic stirrer for one minute. The solution was then placed on a hot plate at 130 (°C) and dissolved for 10 minutes with a magnetic stirrer (Fig.1_2). Next, the beaker was transferred to the oven, and the reaction was allowed to continue for 3 and a half hours without stirring. After this period, the beaker was removed from the oven and placed under the hood until the next day to cool (Fig.1_3).

<h2>Step 2: Centrifugation Process</h2>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The next day, when the synthesized solution had cooled to room temperature, it was centrifuged to obtain pure silver nanowires. The contents of the beaker were divided into four falcon tubes. Falcons placed opposite each other in the centrifuge had to be of equal weight. Subsequently, all the falcon tubes were weighed and placed in the centrifuge. The solution was centrifuged at a temperature of 11°C for 10 minutes at a speed of 4500 rpm. The separated liquid, which was actually ethylene glycol, was discarded, and DI water was poured into the falcon tubes to separate the excess material from the nanowires after centrifugation. The solution was centrifuged again at a temperature of 11 (°C) at a speed of 4500 (rpm) for 10 minutes, and the separated liquid was discarded. Then, ethanol was poured into the falcon tubes to dissolve the PVP attached to the nanowires, which was subsequently discarded.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Finally, the resulting silver nanowires were dispersed in water or ethanol and stored in the refrigerator.
 <br>
</div>


<h2>Step 3: Investigating Properties and Structure</h2>



<div style='text-align: justify;'>
A drop of the final solution is poured onto a microscope slide, and it is observed and examined under an optical microscope. According to Fig. 5, the synthesized silver nanowires are found to be of very high quality. However, due to its high concentration, it needs to be diluted for further investigation.
 <br>
 <br>
</div>


<div style='text-align: justify;'>
In the next step, a drop of the silver nanowire solution was diluted in a large amount of ethanol, and subsequently, it was placed on the microscope slide with the assistance of a syringe. It was then observed via the optical microscope that a long length and a small diameter (high aspect ratio) were achieved.

For further investigation, SEM images of the AgNWs thin film were captured with a resolution of 500nm and 5μm, as depicted in Fig. 4. According to these images, it can be observed that silver nanowires synthesized using the described Polyol method exhibit a high aspect ratio, consequently resulting in their possession of very high transparency, flexibility, and electrical conductivity.

<h2>Step 4: Junction Welding Process</h2>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
After the synthesis and centrifugation of silver nanowires, a very high initial resistance is exhibited by them. While silver nanowires are being coated on the substrate, they are stacked on top of each other, and at the junction spots, the resistance reaches approximately 10<sup>12</sup> - 10<sup>14</sup>. Therefore, the necessity for welding silver nanowires arises.
 <br>
  <br>
 In this research, a combination of the following two methods has been employed for this purpose. Indeed, the purpose has been served by initially performing the Rapid Thermal Welding Method, followed by the Halide Welding for Silver Nanowire Network Electrodes.
 <br>
   <br>
1. Rapid Thermal Welding Method:
  <br>
In this method, the silver nanowires on the substrate are placed on a hot plate for ten minutes and subjected to Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) at a temperature of 120°C [2].
 <br>
   <br>
2. Halide Welding for Silver Nanowire Network Electrode:
  <br>
In this method, a 0.5M solution of NaCl salt is first prepared. Then, the silver nanowires coated on the substrate are immersed in this solution for 30 seconds and subsequently rinsed with distilled water (DI) for another 30 seconds [3].

 <br>
</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Through this approach, a sheet resistance of 5.7Ω/sq is attained for AgNWs, and an increase in light transmittance up to 92% is observed. Additionally, an enhancement in mechanical flexibility is noted.
<br>
</div>

<h2>Step 5: Addressing and Resolving the Challenge of Silver Nanowire Adhesion to Substrates</h2>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
When these nanowires were coated onto various surfaces, it was observed that they did not adhere to the surface adequately and could be detached from the surface with minimal contact. To address this issue, different methods of enhancing adhesion were explored. Ultimately, Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) material was employed for this purpose, representing a cost-effective, straightforward, and efficient method.
 <br>
  <br>
</div>


<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The sheet resistance of the AgNWs/HEC composite layer was found to be 70 (Ω/sq). The adhesion of the AgNWs/HEC conductive solution to the substrate was evaluated by subjecting it to contact with harsh objects, and it was observed that detachment from the surface did not occur. Therefore, the problem of non-adhesion of silver nanowires to the surface was resolved through the utilization of HEC. This level of adhesion is considered excellent for conductive and transparent layers without the need for any restoration operations.
