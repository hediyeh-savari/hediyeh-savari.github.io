(e) The electrical resistance of the electrodes formed on the TPU was measured.</figcaption>

</div>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
The resistance of each electrode was found to be 2.2 kΩ, which was deemed high for silver nanowires with a conductivity of 3 Ω. Conversely, when the mask was removed from the TPU surface, some of the silver nanowires that had adhered to the mask were lifted along with it. Furthermore, the layer on the TPU surface was found to be non-uniform. Consequently, this method was also rejected.

<h1>5. Fabrication of Flexible Electrode Using Shadow Mask and DC Sputtering</h1>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
High precision was required for the fabrication of flexible electrodes, and conventional coating methods were found to be inadequate in producing appropriate results. None of the previous methods were deemed accurate enough. Consequently, the DC Sputtering method was employed for deposition. Additionally, a silver metal target was utilized in place of silver nanowires.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
 To deposit silver on the TPU surface, the silver target surface is first cleaned with acetone to remove grease and impurities, and the acetone is allowed to evaporate completely. Then, the target and the samples are placed in the device as shown below. The chamber is closed, and argon gas is introduced. The power is set to 20%, and the time is set to 300 seconds. Purple plasma is generated inside the chamber, and physical sputtering is conducted. The sputtering operation is then performed four times to deposit a thin, highly conductive silver layer onto the TPU surface.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Using this first-of-its-kind method, fine electrodes were patterned with 100-micron precision and exceptional uniformity on a fully flexible thermoplastic polyurethane surface. The accuracy and cleanliness of this method were excellent, and the sensor substrate remained uncontaminated, allowing the desired design to function effectively. With this method, any metal can be deposited with any desired design on any desired substrate. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, silver electrodes fabricated on thermoplastic polyurethane exhibit good flexibility. Their conductivity was measured using a multimeter, and a sheet resistance of 3 (Ω/sq) was determined.

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
To assess the precision of the deposited flexible electrodes, their structure was analyzed using an optical microscope, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

For a comprehensive analysis of these electrodes, SEM images were captured, as illustrated in Fig. 8, and an in-depth investigation of their properties was undertaken.

The electrical conductivity of these fabric-based electrodes was not as high as that on TPU, but their electrical conductivity was still good enough.
