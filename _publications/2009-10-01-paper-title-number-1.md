A multifunctional sensor with the capability to measure strain and pressure was fabricated. The Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) substrate used in this project was produced from TPU grains with a precise recipe. Subsequently, the silver electrodes were deposited in a pre-designed pattern on the TPU substrate using the DC sputtering method. Additionally, FMWCNT/TPU and FMWCNT-PANI/TPU composites were synthesized and employed as sensitive materials. The strain sensor showed its maximum sensitivity at Îµ=100% for both sensitive materials, while the pressure sensors exhibited their peak sensitivity at P=0.01 (MPa). Furthermore, the strain sensors displayed linear responses, whereas the pressure sensors demonstrated non-linear responses.
