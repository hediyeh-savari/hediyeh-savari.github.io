This research project explores various methods for fabricating flexible electrodes using techniques such as photolithography, 3D printing, spray deposition, drop-casting method, and DC sputtering. Despite initial challenges and unsatisfactory outcomes encountered in the early stages, the DC sputtering method emerged as the most promising approach for the deposition of silver electrodes onto thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and fabric substrates. This novel method demonstrated exceptional precision and uniformity, resulting in fully flexible electrodes with a sheet resistance of 3 (Î©/sq). The study extensively examines the structural and electrical properties of the fabricated electrodes using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), establishing the efficacy and versatility of the DC sputtering technique in producing highly functional and adaptable flexible electrodes for flexible electronics applications.
